Lithium-ion batteries have a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to automotive applications, grid energy
storage etc. Safe and efficient operation of the battery and fast charging without compromising the lifetime are some of the critical
issues. In this work, we model a lithium-ion battery using a second-order equivalent circuit model and propose a stochastic model
predictive control-based charging approach. The stochastic approach showed an improved result over the nominal one when
dealing with disturbances. Fast charging without an active cooling mechanism did not have significant advantages over normal
charging operation as it was constrained by the maximum allowed core temperature. The battery degradation, on the other hand,
almost doubled for fast charging. A compromised charging rate of 2C seemed to be more appropriate. In addition, a simulation
result of degradation over 1000 charging cycles at this rate was approximately 12%.
